# Provisioning V2

> **Note**: The term "bootstrapping" comes from the phrase "to pull oneself by one's bootstraps". It refers to a self-starting process that continues and grows without any user input.
>
> In the case of Kubernetes components installed by Kubernetes distributions, this applies since the Kubernetes components themselves are typically managed by some underlying daemon on the host (i.e. `systemd`, `Docker`, etc.) that differs depending on the Kubernetes distribution you are working with, so they are self-[re]starting processes that are capable of "pulling themselves by their bootstraps" once they have been started.
>
> This is why the process of installing the Kubernetes distribution onto a node is typically referred to as "bootstrapping" a node.
>
> However, it's important to distinguish between **bootstrapping** components, which is a **one-time** action on a node to start the self-healing processes, and **managing** components, which is a **continual** process that can receive user input to alter the behavior or configuration of the running self-healing processes.

> Upstream CAPI only supports bootstrapping. This is why, in the upstream CAPI world, `Machines` are immutable, `MachineDeployments` **replace** `Machines` instead of **re-configuring** the existing `Machine`, and "remediation" for failed `MachineHealthChecks` **delete** the unhealthy node (presumably to be replaced to satisfy the `MachineSet` requirements); however, this is not the case for Rancher's Provisioning V2 framework, which uses [`rancher/system-agent`](https://github.com/rancher/system-agent) to manage existing nodes without deleting them on changes to the cluster's configuration.
>
> On the other hand, Rancher supports both bootstrapping and managing existing nodes. This is discussed in more detail below as we outline the way Provisioning V2 actually works under the hood.
